# Automated-Drone
This project is mainly developed for aerial monitoring systems, traffic control &amp; other surveillance work.  There are two ways for controlling this system - Flysky Transmitter or any PC/Laptop. 
Electronics Part - An APM controller and a ESP-32 Cam module is the main part of this project. A GPS is used for better stability in the time of surveillance and a telemetry is used for monitoring as well as controlling the drone from the PC. Some sensors are attached with this system, we can also monitor it anytime through PC/Laptop.
Design Part - The double layer quad-frame designed by white & yellow acrylic material. Their base and top part is designed by 3 mm fluorescent yellow acrylic, on the other hand 6 mm white acrylic is used for wings & bit.
